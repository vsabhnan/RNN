## Running Instructions

The file main.py can be run to replicate the results in the report. It calls functions from the remaining py files to run the various experiments. Please make sure to place the dataset “IMDB Dataset.csv” in the data folder, found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews. 

Expected run time is about an hour to an hour and a half. It will output all the results into “results/experiment_results”.csv. Formatted spreadsheet with results and some of the charts can be found in the repository under “results/results_formatted.xlsx”, these will not be updated automatically when the code is run. Finally, the plot containing the best and worst model can be found under "plots/loss_comparison.png" and will also be updated when the code is run.

Requirements (python version and packages) are included in Requirements.txt.
